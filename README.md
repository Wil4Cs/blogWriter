# blogWriter

PHP Version 7.1.0 was used to build this app. It means short open tags are available. So make sure to enable its in your php.ini (short_open_tag = On ).
Then restart your Apache server.

Afterward you have just to fill config files in App/config. Enter your database details and choose a login with a password to access admin page! The way to acces admin is yourhostname/?controller=back&action=index

Enjoy !!!

This app has been developed to validate my project 3 with Openclassrooms.

Special thanks to my mentor, Alexis, for his support.
